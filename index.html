              "Roll The Dice" is an exciting and competitive game that will keep
              you on the edge of your seat. In this two-player game, your goal
              is to be the first to reach a total score of 100. The game is
              played with a virtual dice, and each player takes turns rolling
              the dice. The gameplay revolves around two buttons: "Roll the
              Dice" and "Pass the Dice."
            </p>
            <p>
              When it's your turn, you can click on the "Roll the Dice" button
              as many times as you want. With each click, your score
              accumulates. However, there's a catch. If you roll a '1' on the
              dice, your current score is reset to zero, and it becomes your
              opponent's turn. So, you need to strategize and decide when to
              stop rolling to safeguard your score.
            </p>
            <p>
              To save your current score and make it a part of your total score,
              you can click on the "Pass the Dice" button. This action transfers
              the accumulated points to your overall score, and it becomes your
              opponent's turn to play. The game continues in this turn-based
              manner, with each player rolling the dice, accumulating points,
              and passing the dice to the other player until one of the players
              reaches a total score of 100.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to start fresh, you have the option to restart the
              game at any time and begin the journey towards 100 points again.
              Engage in this thrilling game of chance and strategy, where every
              roll of the dice could make or break your progress. Will you be
              the first player to reach 100 points and emerge victorious in
              "Roll The Dice"?
