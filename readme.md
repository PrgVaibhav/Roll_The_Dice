# Roll The Dice

"Roll The Dice" is an interactive two-player game where the objective is to reach a total score of 100 before your opponent. This game combines luck and strategy as players take turns rolling a virtual dice to accumulate points. However, rolling a '1' on the dice resets the current score to zero, adding an element of risk and decision-making.

## Features

- Two-player game with turn-based gameplay.
- Roll the dice button to accumulate points.
- Pass the dice button to save the current score and transfer it to the total score.
- Score reset to zero if a '1' is rolled on the dice.
- Restart option to begin a new game.

## Usage

1.  Open the game in your web browser.
2.  Player 1 starts the game and can click the "Roll the Dice" button multiple times to accumulate points. However, rolling a '1' will reset the current score to zero.
3.  Player 1 can choose to click the "Pass the Dice" button to save their accumulated score and transfer it to their total score. It becomes Player 2's turn.
4.  Player 2 follows the same steps as Player 1, trying to accumulate points without rolling a '1'.
5.  The game continues in a turn-based fashion until one of the players reaches a total score of 100.
6.  At any point, players can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button.
