# Roll The Dice 

"Roll The Dice" is an interactive two-player game where the objective is to reach a total score of 100 before your opponent. This game combines luck and strategy as players take turns rolling a virtual dice to accumulate points. However, rolling a '1' on the dice resets the current score to zero, adding an element of risk and decision-making.
